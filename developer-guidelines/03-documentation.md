# Documentation

Documentation is fundamental to ensure usability and usefulness of the software.
It must be stored along the code, ideally in the repository's `docs` folder.
Basic documentation should also be included in the [README](02-readme.md).

Documentation is relevant in many forms, each of which should be addressed for different audiences
with variying degree of experience and knowledge.

1. User documentation
   Include a documentation for end users, including e.g.
   * Examples
   * Tutorials
   * How-Tos
   * FAQs
   * Screencasts
   * API documentation

1. Developer documentation
   Provide instructions for developers.
   * How to set up the environment.
   * Dependencies, including

     * Supported operating systems.
     * Required libraries.
     * External dependencies.

   * Requirements, e.g. hardware, architecture, CPU, RAM, disk space and network bandwidth.
   * How to build the code.
   * How to package the code.

1. Inline code documentation
   * Always adhere to the language's standard.
   When in doubt, follow the [Google Style Guides](https://google.github.io/styleguide/).

## Services

If the software works as a daemon, i.e. a micro service, additional operation documentation is required:

* Configuration instructions
* Startup script (e. g. init or systemd)
* Monitoring setup, ideally through a monitoring endpoint.
