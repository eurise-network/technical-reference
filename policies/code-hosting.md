# Code Hosting Policies

## General Rules

Make sure to publish your code in a public repository.

* There are a number of well-known commercial solutions, such as:

  * [GitHub](https://github.com/pricing)
  * [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-com/)
  * [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product/pricing)

  They all offer some free options and using them has a number of advantages, e.g.:

  * Good and established usability
  * High visibility of you code
  * Low barrier for findability and re-use
  * Good integration with other services and solutions

  When using commercial and in particular external services you must have

* There are a number of possibilities to host your own solution

  * The commercial solutions above.
  * [GitLab Community Edition](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org)
  * [Gogs](https://gogs.io/)
  * [Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/)
  * [gitolite](http://gitolite.com/gitolite/index.html)

## Specific Solutions

### On Site

* Be sure to implement all relevant operational procedures.

### GitHub

When using GitHub, implementing a suitable policy is recommended.

#### Organizations

GitHub organizations can be used to group all repositories of an institution or a research project.
It should be clearly stated who is responsible for an organization, ideally stated in the organization's GitHub Page.

Always ensure rights are managed by a sufficient number of people:

* At least two people should be owner of the organization.  
  It may be appropriate to have two owners from each institution involved in the project.

* Create an institutional account. This account becomes owner of all organizations
  the institution is involved in and makes sure access is ensured from individual employees.

Organizations should have a policy on who can be a member and how repository
maintainers and maintenance status are defined and communicated.

#### Backup

As GitHub is a commercial company, the service provided through GitHub is subject to change through corporate development.
It is highly recommended to set up an automated backup system, in order to ensure that a copy
of all code and metadata (including issues, wikis etc.) exists.

#### Features

Use the features provided by GitHub, such as issue labels, issue and pull-request templates etc.
