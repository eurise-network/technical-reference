DARIAH Technical Reference
==========================

This is the technical reference for the DARIAH Infrastructure. It is a collection of basic guidelines and references for development and
maintenance of infrastructure services within DARIAH and beyond. This work relies heavily on work by the community and in particular
`CESSDA ERIC <https://www.cessda.eu/>`__, `CLARIAH-NL <https://www.clariah.nl/>`__, `DARIAH-DE <https://de.dariah.eu/>`__ as well as the
`Netherlands eScience Center <https://esciencecenter.nl/>`__ and the `UK Software Sustainability Institute <https://www.software.ac.uk>`__.

This work explicitly relies on the `Netherlands eScience Center Guide <https://guide.esciencecenter.nl/>`__ and the `CLARIAH Software Quality
Guidelines <https://github.com/CLARIAH/software-quality-guidelines>`__.

To make use of these guides, implementing an institutional manual based on this is recommended. In many places, possible or required
choices are pointed out and should be made for a specific manual.

It is particularly recommended to adopt the `Recommendations to encourage best practices in research
software <https://softdev4research.github.io/recommendations/>`__ whenever starting a new project.
Also, consider using the `Software Sustainability Institute <https://www.software.ac.uk>`__'s `Software
Management Plan <https://www.software.ac.uk/software-management-plans>`__.
