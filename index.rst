EURISE Network Technical Reference
==================================

This is the common Technical Reference developed by the EURISE Network.

This is the common Technical Reference developed by the [EURISE Network](https://eurise-network.github.io/), a cooperation of
[CESSDA ERIC](https://www.cessda.eu/), [CLARIN ERIC](https://www.clarin.eu/) and [DARIAH ERIC](https://www.dariah.eu/).

The EURISE Network Technical Reference, is a collection of guidelines and how-tos,
mainly aimed at developers contributing to the participating infrastructures.
It serves as a combined introduction to many aspects of software engineering, while being neutral with respect to particular choices.
This ensures the largest possible intersection of recommendations, while allowing the partners to implement their own specifications on top.

To make use of these guides, implementing an institutional manual based on this is recommended.
In many places, possible or required choices are pointed out and should be made for a specific manual.

It is particularly recommended to adopt the `Recommendations to encourage best practices in research
software <https://softdev4research.github.io/recommendations/>`__ whenever starting a new project.
Also, consider using the `Software Sustainability Institute <https://www.software.ac.uk>`__'s `Software
Management Plan <https://www.software.ac.uk/software-management-plans>`__.
